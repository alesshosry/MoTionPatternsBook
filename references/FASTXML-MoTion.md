# FASTXML + MoTion Playbook (Pharo)

This document is dedicated for writing MoTion patterns to match a FASTXML model. Some may want to analyse XML files and search for specific nodes... This is why you can benefit from MoTion to express the patterns you want, and use FASTXML metamodel which allows representing XML nodes in Pharo. The combination of both tools, will allow you to apply any search. 

## 1) Requirements / Packages
- [FASTXML (metamodel + parser)](https://github.com/Evref-BL/FASTXML)
- [MoTion](https://github.com/alesshosry/Motion)

## 2) Parse XML and get the Document node

```smalltalk
string := '// XML'.
res := FASTXMLParser new parse: string.
"res will be a FASTXMLModel; we need to access the #entities inside👇🏻"

"Document entity: is the top entity of every xml model"
prog := (res entities detect: [ :ent | ent class = FASTXMLDocument ])
```

## 3) Core MoTion traversal idioms

### 3.1) Recursive descent (find a node anywhere)
Use `#'children*'` from `FASTXMLDocument` to search anywhere in the subtree.

```smalltalk
pattern := FASTXMLDocument % {
  #'children*' <=> SomeNodeClass % { } as: #aNode
}.
results := pattern collectBindings: { #aNode } for: prog.
```

### 3.2) Immediate child constraint (avoid cross-product matches)
Use `#genericChildren` (no `*`) with list patterns when you need **direct** structural relationships.

```smalltalk
pattern := SomeNodeClass % {
  #genericChildren <=> { #'*_'. ChildNodeClass % { } as: #child. #'*_' }
}.
"this means you are looking for a SomeNodeClass that has direct children ChildNodeClass and possibly other children #'*_' "
```

## 4) Example patterns
"comming soon"

## 5) Debugging tips

### 5.1) Inspect children to learn structure
```smalltalk
node genericChildren collect: #class.
node genericChildren.
```

### 5.2) Why you got too many matches
- Using `#'genericChildren*'` matches *descendants*, producing cross-products when nested structures exist.
- Prefer `#genericChildren` when you mean “direct child”.

### 6) FASTXML entities
In order to express a pattern effitiently, MoTion needs to know the class names representing the entities of XML. This is why we are listing them here in accordance to there slots that can be used while expressing a MoTion pattern. Knowing that this is not the final list, many properties are still missing and need to be adapted. This will be done in the near future. Meanwhile the list is:

```smalltalk
FASTXMLAttDef
FASTXMLAttValue
FASTXMLAttlistDecl
FASTXMLAttribute
FASTXMLCDSect
FASTXMLCDStart
FASTXMLCData
FASTXMLCharData
FASTXMLCharRef
FASTXMLChildren
FASTXMLComment
FASTXMLContent
FASTXMLContentspec
FASTXMLDefaultDecl
FASTXMLDoctypedecl
FASTXMLDocument, slots: source element 
FASTXMLERROR, slots: source element 
FASTXMLETag
FASTXMLElement
FASTXMLElementdecl
FASTXMLEmptyElemTag
FASTXMLEncName
FASTXMLEntityRef
FASTXMLEntityValue
FASTXMLEnumeration
FASTXMLExternalID
FASTXMLGEDecl
FASTXMLMixed
FASTXMLNDataDecl
FASTXMLName
FASTXMLNmtoken
FASTXMLNotationDecl
FASTXMLNotationType
FASTXMLPEDecl
FASTXMLPEReference
FASTXMLPI
FASTXMLPITarget
FASTXMLProlog
FASTXMLPseudoAtt
FASTXMLPseudoAttValue
FASTXMLPubidLiteral
FASTXMLPublicID
FASTXMLSTag
FASTXMLStringType
FASTXMLStyleSheetPI
FASTXMLSystemLiteral
FASTXMLTokenizedType
FASTXMLURI
FASTXMLVersionNum
FASTXMLXMLDecl
FASTXMLXmlModelPI
```

As you notice, no slots in this metamodel, yet ! 
Also slots are upcoming soon
